"""
tax_ca.py -- a small Canadian personal income-tax engine.

Computes combined federal + provincial tax on an individual's taxable income,
the main retirement non-refundable credits (age amount + pension income amount),
the OAS Recovery Tax (clawback), and -- for Quebec -- the individual Health
Services Fund (HSF) contribution. Brackets, credits, and thresholds are indexed
forward from a base year by an inflation rate, so the engine works across a
multi-decade projection.

Scope / honesty:
  * ALL 10 provinces + 3 territories are fully encoded (sourced 2025 figures; see
    docs/CANADA_RULES.md). An unrecognized province code falls back to Ontario with
    a one-time warning.
  * Quebec is special: its own brackets and a higher Basic Personal Amount, NO
    provincial surtax, the 16.5% "Quebec abatement" that reduces a Quebec
    resident's FEDERAL tax, a bundled (family-income-tested) age/retirement
    credit, and the individual HSF contribution on pension/investment income.
    QPP is taxed like CPP (enter it in the cpp_monthly fields).
  * Retirement credits modelled: the age amount (65+, income-tested) and the
    pension income amount, federal + provincial. The federal and Manitoba
    high-income BPA phase-downs are modelled. NOT modelled: every other
    non-refundable credit, the dividend tax credit, and the capital-gains 50%
    inclusion. Illustrative only.

This is illustrative, not tax advice. Verify against CRA / Revenu Quebec.
